### Hi there üëã

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
I interpret users needs by listening to everything they tell me via in person on through email, phone etc. and then I carefully figure out how to implement them into the program. Creating user stories helps with this because it allows me to get a better idea of what they want and also allows me to keep a record so the team can always go back to it to make sure they did everything they were supposed to.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by using the Scrum-agile approach. I slowly take things one step at a time to make sure I don't miss anything and if anything changes I can easily deal with those changes. It also helps me to work with a team so we can all be on the same pages and stay up to datew with any new information or needs/wants from the customer.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development it means that you can collaborate effectively with others and make sure you do your part and not hold the team back as well as helping the team move forward in a timely and fashionable manner. You're able to work together to better understand the customers needs and create proper user stories so you can always have a reference to look back on and make sure you have everything you need.
